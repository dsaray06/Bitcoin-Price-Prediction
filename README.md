# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
I used VS Code for this project. If you run in VS Code, click the drop down next to the run button and click "Run Current File in Interactive Window". 
This will display the graph predicting the Bitcoin price up to July 2025. 
It uses a dataset of all previous Bitcoin prices (included in repo) to predict future pricing.
